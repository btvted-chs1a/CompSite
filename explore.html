    <h1>THE COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER AND THEIR  FUNCTIONALITY</h1>
    <input type="image" src="system-unit.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>System Unit</h2>
    <p>It is also known as the computer case. This is the section of the computer system that houses every component.</p> 
    <p>It is typically made to facilitate installing a motherboard, cables, and drives as simply as possible. Some are </p>
    <p>so expertly made that maintaining a neat and appealing appearance is simple.</p>


    <input type="image" src="motherboard.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>This is the main board that is fastened to the computer chassis with screws. Everything else, including additional</p> 
    <p>cards, connects directly to the motherboard, thus its name. It has connections for the CPU, RAM, disks, power supply,</p>
    <p>and other components. All the physical parts must be integrated to work and communicate together for it to perform its role.</p>


    <input type="image" src="cpu.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p> The CPU can be thought of as the brain of computers. It performs computer processing on each piece of data. It executes every</p> 
    <p>process in the RAM in order to complete the tasks needed by the computer system. The central processing unit is often installed</p>
    <p> in a socket that fastens the CPU to the motherboard using a lever or latches with a hinged plate that has a hole in the middle.</p>
    <p>Underneath it, there are several copper pads that the socket contacts must push up against in order to make electrical contact.</p>


    <input type="image" src="ram.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p> A type of data storage that allows for quick read and write access. RAM is a volatile memory, which means that when power is disconnected</p> 
    <p> all of the data is lost. It maintains data available for processing by the CPU. The overall speed of a computer system is significantly influenced</p>
    <p> by the RAM speed. Additionally, it connects straight into a lengthy slot with contacts on either side. Like a processor, it too has a clock speed.</p>
    <p> In order to give performance above and beyond the designed specification, it can also be overclocked.A heat spreader is sold with some RAM modules</p>
    <p> It helps the memory ICs stay cooler by dissipating heat from each one of them.</p>


    <input type="image" src="gpu.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Graphics Card or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
    <p> The data from the motherboard is processed by a graphics card, which is an output device that provides the required data to the computer's screen for display.</p> 
    <p> wherein you may use HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, or VGA ports to attach monitors to it. It is also known as a video card or display card.</p>
    <p> The main CPU is relieved of all video processing duties by a video card. This significantly improves a computer's performance.</p>
    <p> The major component of a computer system that requires cooling is the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which is found on a graphics card.</p>
   
    
    <input type="image" src="sound.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Sound Card</h2>
    <p> For audio output, this component of the motherboard is typically employed. A computer can connect sound cards in several different ways. </p> 
    <p> Through a PCI, USB, or PCI Express x 1 slot are all options. The entire audio processing is handled by a sound processing chip on the card,</p>
    <p> which is typically a fairly weak processor. It card can provide a variety of connectivity options with different audio equipment.</p>


    <input type="image" src="hdd.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</h2>
    <p> Many PCs still come with hard drives today. All of your information is stored on a mechanical drive so that it can be retrieved at any moment.</p> 
    <p> It serves as a boot drive to start your computer's operating system (OS) in addition to serving as a storage device for data. Depending on your demands,</p>
    <p> you can install various operating systems. An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that is placed on a computer to enable its operation, </p>
    <p> such as Microsoft Windows. The physical fragility of a mechanical drive is its major weakness. One incorrect bump can completely ruin driving.</p>
    <p> One or more platters on a mechanical hard drive spin anywhere between 5200 and 10000 RPM (revolutions per minute)</p>


    <input type="image" src="ssd.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Solid State Drive (SSD)</h2>
    <p> A different kind of hard drive is an SSD, which has no moving parts. It comprises a bank of flash memory with a respectable quantity of data </p> 
    <p> storage capacity. A high-performance drive is the SSD. Due to its speed, it cannot be easily broken by being dropped or receiving minor impacts.</p>


    <input type="image" src="psu.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
    <p> The computer case has a power supply device mounted inside. It converts the wall outlet power cord's AC mains supply into the proper DC voltages,</p> 
    <p> which are then sent to all of the computer's internal components. It is crucial to a computer's continued dependability. For power supply, there are many</p>
    <p> wattage ratings. The electrical current that can be made accessible to everything that requires it to operate properly increases with increasing wattage. A cooling </p>
    <p> fan is typically included with a power supply. This keeps your computer's internal parts from overheating even when the power supply is under heavier stress.</p>


    <input type="image" src="vdu.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Visual Display Unit (VDU)</h2>
    <p> An output device, such as a monitor, is used to display the graphical data transmitted by the computer's GPU. In order to </p> 
    <p> meet the high expectations necessary to remove delays with user input for gaming, monitors also have a quick response time.</p>


    <input type="image" src="keyboard.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Keyboard</h2>
    <p> One of the ways to interact with a computer is through an input device like a keyboard. When a key is touched</p> 
    <p> on the keyboard, a tiny amount of data is sent to the computer to let it know which key was pressed.</p>


    <input type="image" src="mouse.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Mouse</h2>
    <p> It is an input device that enables more natural interaction with computer systems</p> 
    <p> by allowing the user to move a pointer that is shown on the monitor.</p>


    <input type="image" src="speaker.jpg" alt="Submit" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Computer Speakers</h2>
    <p> The sound card at the back of the computer can be used to connect computer speakers. </p> 
    <p> Another approach to connect them is using a monitor with built-in speakers.</p>
